# US Citizenship Test App

An app to help users prepare for the US Citizenship Test with flashcards, multiple choice questions, writing practice, reading practice, and simulated interviews.

After helping my wife study for her citizenship test, I realized the stresful and high stakes this test can be for immigrants. Many don't have access to good study materials or structured practice. This app aims to fill that gap by providing a free, easy-to-use, comprehensive study tool.
