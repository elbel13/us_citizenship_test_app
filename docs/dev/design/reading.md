# Reading Practice Design

The Reading Practice screen is designed to help users improve their reading skills in preparation for the US Citizenship Test. This screen presents users with a series of sentences that they must read aloud. The app uses speech recognition to evaluate the user's pronunciation and fluency.

## Practice Sentances

The sentances used for reading are generated using the vocab list from USCIS. The sentances are generated in a way that makes grammatical sense. They should also be relevant to the context of the citizenship test and not contain innacurate or misleading information.

## Scoring
The app uses Flutter's speech recognition package to capture the user's reading. The captured speech is then compared to the expected text using a simple string comparison algorithm. The app provides feedback on pronunciation accuracy and fluency. Simple pronounciation mistakes are acceptable as long as the overall meaning is clear.

## Technical Implementation

### Speech Recognition
- **Package**: `speech_to_text`
- Uses native platform speech recognition (Google on Android, Apple on iOS)
- Works offline after initial setup
- No API costs

### Text Similarity Evaluation
- **Package**: `string_similarity`
- Uses Levenshtein Distance algorithm to calculate similarity between expected and spoken text
- Normalizes text (lowercase, removes punctuation) before comparison
- Returns similarity score from 0.0 to 1.0

### Scoring Algorithm
1. Normalize both expected and spoken text (lowercase, remove punctuation)
2. Calculate similarity score using Levenshtein distance
3. Apply threshold: 80% similarity = pass
4. Provide word-level feedback for mismatched words

### Required Permissions
- Microphone access (`permission_handler` package)
- Speech recognition initialization on first use

### Sentence Generation

Sentences are generated using a template-based approach with the reading vocabulary:

**Approach 1: Predefined Sentence Bank**
- Create a curated list of ~100 simple sentences using only vocabulary words
- Store in JSON file similar to questions
- Ensures accuracy and grammatical correctness
- Examples from USCIS actual test sentences:
  - "Who is the President?"
  - "Abraham Lincoln was the President."
  - "George Washington was the Father of Our Country."
  - "The people elect Congress."

**Approach 2: Template-Based Generation**
- Use sentence templates with placeholders for vocabulary categories
- Templates ensure grammatical correctness
- Example templates:
  - "[Person] was [position]" → "Abraham Lincoln was President"
  - "The [place] has [number] states" → "The United States has many states"
  - "We pay [noun]" → "We pay the dollar bill"
  - "[Question] is the capital?" → "What is the capital?"
  
**Selected: Hybrid Approach**
- Start with predefined sentences stored in `assets/reading_sentences.json`
- Sentences are generated by the system and verified by humans for accuracy
- Use templates to expand variety when needed
- All sentences remain simple (5-10 words)
- Factual accuracy verified for civics content
- Can add new sentences to JSON file over time
